  # Now if another pull request gets merged in the time window during the publish-local and a scripted job, the base branches moves forward
  # and the CI server will now clone that newer base branch before "fetching" the current PR on it. Of course now the commit hash has changed and
  # the distance from the latest tag has increased, so the Play version set by dynver will be different than the one used for publish-local, resulting
  # in "unresolved dependencies" errors.
